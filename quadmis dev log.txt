I am writing the code for the JavaFX overhead. Currently, I am looking at event handlers, and internally debating between
2 control structures:

-> Direct Event Capture

# Pros:
# > Direct checks of the state of input devices
# > Simple logic
# Cons:
# > Undefined behavior if there is a new input event during an update
# > Creates additional overhead on the main thread

-> Asynchronous Event Capture
# Pros:
# > Pushes event capture to its own thread
# > Async is fine, as main thread only reads from a data structure, thus no dual write conflicts
# Cons:
# > Complex logic
# > New application of code prone is error-prone

Asynchronous seems better in the long run, and once working also provides an unsung benefit:
de-spaghettification. Having cleaner code will ALWAYS result in fewer, easier-to-diagnose bugs, especially considering
that this will be pushed to its own process.

The JavaFX overhead and some organizational code is done. Worked out a hard-to-diagnose
bug involving the FXML file, namely a bad naming.

...wow that's a timestamp. Uh. I implemented the rendering logic, now there's the controls and checking the rotation logic...
